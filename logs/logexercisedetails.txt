    "description": "Take your hand palm side down, put it flat on a table or desk. Spread your fingers as much as you can. Push down with your palm, straighten your elbow and then lean straight forward, keeping your arm and hand in a nice straight line. The more that you go forward, the more that you're going to feel a deep stretch in the back part of the wrist. Hold the stretch for 5 seconds, then relax and repeat up to 10 times. To take this one to next level, flip your hand over palm side up and repeat the same steps."
