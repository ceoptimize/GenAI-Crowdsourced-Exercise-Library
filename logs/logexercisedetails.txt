First up, narrow push ups. These will focus on your inner chest or the pectoral muscles. Next we'll move into wide push ups to target the serratus anterior muscles, or the outer part of your chest. Now we go into Skullcrushers. These are great for your triceps if you want that horseshoe shape. Moving on to staggered push ups. This is a moving push up, so it's going to be great for your triceps and building your core. If you want to build the muscles in your lower and upper back then you need to do these archer push ups. Last but not least, hand release push ups to increase force off the ground and to strengthen your core and shoulders.", 'total_time_seconds': 34}", provide exercise details in the following format:

First up, narrow push ups. These will focus on your inner chest or the pectoral muscles. Next we'll move into wide push ups to target the serratus anterior muscles, or the outer part of your chest. Now we go into Skullcrushers. These are great for your triceps if you want that horseshoe shape. Moving on to staggered push ups. This is a moving push up, so it's going to be great for your triceps and building your core. If you want to build the muscles in your lower and upper back then you need to do these archer push ups.
