Now we go into Skullcrushers. These are great for your triceps if you want that horseshoe shape. Moving on to staggered push ups. This is a moving push up, so it's going to be great for your triceps and building your core. If you want to build the muscles in your lower and upper back then you need to do these archer push ups.

So here, similar to a push-up, you're moving your body in a push-up position. Going to a wall makes it really easy because you don't have full gravity of your body on your arms. But if you're going against a wall, the goal of it is you're trying to pull your scapula off of your ribs and then back, so pull it back, pull it back. So here, we're up against a wall, you're leaning in, you're getting your feet in a position that is comfortable, leaning in so it's an inch off of that ribcage, and then you're coming up. And a little bit even more rounded, and that's great. So you're gonna go in towards the wall, and then push back away. Push in, so this is the push-up. All you're doing is just moving that scapula up and down that ribcage so that you're getting mobility between those bones, where typically we don't get a lot of mobility. So you're gonna do a set of 10 twice. As you get better at this, you're gonna wanna go onto the ground.", 'total_time_seconds': 59}", provide exercise details in the following format:

The third one is the one that has helped me the most! Always warm up the wrist first. This helps with wrist strength and mobility and can prevent injury or strain in the joints. Start standing with your palms forward and your thumbs in line with your armpits. Keep your feet planted firmly and think about pushing open a heavy door. Start with wall push-ups. High reps will help you get used to proper form and will help build strength. Over time, begin to lower your incline try using a bench or stair riser. Once you're able to properly complete three sets of ten, lower your incline again and perform kneeling push-ups. Once you hit 3 sets of 10 here, with proper form, try a negative push-up. Lower yourself slowly until your chest hits the floor and then press up using the knees for support. Continue this way until you can press yourself up without using the knees. Be consistent and be patient. I know push-ups can be a challenge but with practice you will get there!", 'total_time_seconds': 59}", provide exercise details in the following format:
