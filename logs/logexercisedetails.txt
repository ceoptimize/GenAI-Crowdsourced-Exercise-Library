So here, similar to a push-up, you're moving your body in a push-up position. Going to a wall makes it really easy because you don't have full gravity of your body on your arms. But if you're going against a wall, the goal of it is you're trying to pull your scapula off of your ribs and then back, so pull it back, pull it back. So here, we're up against a wall, you're leaning in, you're getting your feet in a position that is comfortable, leaning in so it's an inch off of that ribcage, and then you're coming up. And a little bit even more rounded, and that's great. So you're gonna go in towards the wall, and then push back away. Push in, so this is the push-up. All you're doing is just moving that scapula up and down that ribcage so that you're getting mobility between those bones, where typically we don't get a lot of mobility. So you're gonna do a set of 10 twice. As you get better at this, you're gonna wanna go onto the ground.", 'total_time_seconds': 59}", provide exercise details in the following format:

Focus on feeling the movement in the upper back and repeat this motion 10 times. As you become more comfortable with this exercise, you can challenge yourself by moving to the ground and performing the same movement."
